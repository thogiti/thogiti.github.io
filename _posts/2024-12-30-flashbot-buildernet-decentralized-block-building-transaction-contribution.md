# WORK IN PROGRESS

# Overview

[BuilderNet](https://buildernet.org/docs/) is a decentralized block building network for Ethereum that ensures transactions remain private and MEV value is fairly redistributed to users. It brings together globally distributed, open-source builder instances—currently operated by Flashbots, Beaverbuild, and Nethermind—to collaboratively assemble blocks while respecting user confidentiality through Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). By increasing participation and returning each transaction’s contributed value to its sender, BuilderNet strengthens Ethereum’s decentralization and resilience. As the system evolves, more node operators can join via the interest form, with eventual plans to transition to fully permissionless operation. 

In this article we will study two main aspects of the Buildernet:
- The ordering algorithm 
- Transaction contribution
