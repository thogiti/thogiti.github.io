## Introduction

As blockchain technology matures, decentralized applications (dApps) face increasing challenges in managing transaction sequencing to optimize user experience, value retention, and security. Traditional blockchain architectures often leave dApps at the mercy of external actors—such as miners, validators, MEV (Miner Extractable Value) extractors—who control transaction ordering and inclusion and rollup sequencers. This lack of control can lead to value leakage, unfair user outcomes, and vulnerabilities to malicious behaviors like frontrunning.

Application-Specific Sequencing (ASS) emerges as a important shift, granting dApps greater authority over the inclusion and ordering of transactions affecting their state. By tailoring sequencing mechanisms to their specific needs, dApps can mitigate negative externalities, internalize value, and enhance overall system efficiency. However, implementing ASS introduces complex trade-offs, particularly between composability and value capture, and raises critical questions about infrastructure design, incentive structures, and the expansive design space.

This article goes into the intricacies of ASS, synthesizing insights from industry experts and exploring the relationships and trade-offs inherent in this design space. I aim to provide a comprehensive view for researchers and developers to further investigate and optimize ASS mechanisms.

Before, we get deep into the application specific sequencing, let us briefly understand the fundamental concepts around sequencing and the vast design spectrum of sequencing, decentralized sequencing and shared sequencing.
