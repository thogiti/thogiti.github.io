## **Abstract**

Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) has emerged as a critical factor influencing fairness, efficiency, and decentralization within blockchain ecosystems. MEV refers to the additional value that can be extracted through the manipulation of transaction ordering, insertion, or censorship within a block. This article presents an in-depth and rigorous model for MEV redistribution, combining mathematical formulations with strategic analyses to understand the dynamics of order flow and value distribution among various blockchain actors. By integrating perspectives from key stakeholders and extending the foundational model, we explore mechanisms that balance equitable redistribution with the minimization of costs to users. The analysis encompasses incentive alignment, proposing an advanced redistribution function that benefits transaction originators while discouraging excessive extraction. Through simulation, game-theoretical analysis, and practical considerations, this study offers comprehensive insights into designing fairer and more efficient blockchain protocols.

## **1. Introduction**

Blockchain technology has fundamentally transformed the landscape of digital transactions, offering decentralized, transparent, and secure platforms for a myriad of applications. Despite these advancements, the phenomenon of Maximal Extractable Value (MEV), formerly known as Miner Extractable Value, presents significant challenges to the integrity and efficiency of these systems. MEV represents the potential profits that miners or validators can extract by manipulating the order of transactions within a block. Such practices can lead to negative externalities, including frontrunning, sandwich attacks, and increased centralization, thereby undermining the core principles of blockchain technology.

The essence of the MEV issue lies in the order flow of transactionsâ€”the sequence in which transactions are processed and included in the blockchain. Manipulating this order can disproportionately benefit certain actors at the expense of others, leading to unfair value distribution and potential security vulnerabilities. To address these challenges, it is imperative to develop a rigorous model that systematically examines MEV redistribution, providing a framework to understand how transaction sequencing impacts value distribution among participants.

This article aims to construct such a model, incorporating mathematical formulations and game-theoretical analyses to explore mechanisms for equitable MEV redistribution. Additionally, by integrating strategic perspectives from key stakeholders, we extend the foundational model to reconcile differing viewpoints and achieve balanced objectives within the blockchain ecosystem. The ultimate goal is to design policies and protocols that promote fairness and efficiency, mitigating the adverse effects of MEV while fostering a healthy, decentralized network.

## **2. Model Components**

To develop a comprehensive understanding of MEV redistribution, it is essential to define the key components of the blockchain ecosystem relevant to our analysis.

### **2.1. Actors in the Blockchain Ecosystem**

The blockchain ecosystem comprises various participants, each playing a distinct role in processing and validating transactions. We identify six primary types of actors:

1. **Originators (O):** Users, wallets, and decentralized applications (dApps) that generate transactions. Originators drive economic activity on the blockchain, seeking to execute transactions that fulfill their personal or business objectives.

2. **Extractors (E):** Entities, often referred to as searchers, that identify and exploit MEV opportunities by manipulating transaction ordering. They employ sophisticated algorithms and strategies to detect potential profits arising from the sequence of transactions.

3. **Builders (B):** Responsible for constructing blocks from a set of transactions. Builders optimize block composition based on criteria such as maximizing transaction fees or MEV extraction. In some cases, builders may also participate in MEV extraction directly.

4. **Validators (V):** Nodes that validate and add blocks to the blockchain, adhering to the consensus protocol (e.g., Proof of Work, Proof of Stake). Validators ensure the integrity and security of the blockchain by confirming the validity of transactions.

5. **Layer 2 Solutions (L2s):** Platforms that provide scalability and improved transaction processing by operating on top of the main blockchain (Layer 1). L2s aim to increase throughput and reduce transaction costs.

6. **Decentralized Applications (dApps) (D):** Applications that operate on the blockchain, interacting with users and facilitating various services such as finance, gaming, and social media. dApps act as intermediaries between users and the blockchain.

### **2.2. Transactions and Their Attributes**

Each transaction $t_i$ in the set of all transactions $T$ is characterized by specific attributes that influence its processing and potential for MEV extraction:

- **Sender Identifier ($s_i$):** The unique address or identity of the entity initiating the transaction.
- **Receiver Identifier ($r_i$):** The unique address or identity of the intended recipient of the transaction.
- **Value Transferred ($v_i$):** The amount of cryptocurrency or digital asset being transferred in the transaction.
- **Gas Price or Transaction Fee ($g_i$):** The fee offered by the originator to incentivize miners or validators to include the transaction in a block.
- **Timestamp ($\tau_i$)**: The time at which the transaction was created, providing temporal context for ordering.
- **Payload or Data ($p_i$)**: Additional data or instructions included with the transaction, which may affect smart contract execution or other functionalities.

These attributes collectively determine the transaction's priority, cost, and susceptibility to MEV exploitation.

### **2.3. Order Flow (OF)**

Order Flow refers to the sequence in which transactions are processed and included in the blockchain. It is a critical factor in MEV extraction, as the ordering can create or eliminate opportunities for profit. The order flow can be represented as a permutation $\sigma$ of the transaction set $T$:

$$\sigma: T \rightarrow \{t_{\sigma(1)}, t_{\sigma(2)}, \dots, t_{\sigma(n)}\}$$

Where $n = |T|$, the total number of transactions.

Order Flow can be categorized into:

- **Public Order Flow:** Transactions are visible to all actors in the network, typically broadcasted to the mempool where they await inclusion in a block. This transparency allows extractors to analyze and potentially exploit transactions.
  
- **Private Order Flow:** Transactions are concealed from certain actors, often through private mempools or encrypted channels. This concealment aims to protect transactions from MEV exploitation by limiting visibility to trusted parties.

### **2.4. MEV Opportunities**

MEV opportunities arise from the ability to reorder, insert, or censor transactions within the blockchain. Each opportunity $m_j \in M$ is associated with a potential extractable value $e_j$. The types of MEV opportunities include:

- **Arbitrage:** Profiting from price discrepancies of the same asset across different markets or exchanges. Extractors can reorder transactions to buy low on one exchange and sell high on another within the same block.
  
- **Liquidations:** Gaining from liquidating under-collateralized positions in lending platforms. By prioritizing liquidation transactions, extractors can capture liquidation fees or collateral.
  
- **Sandwich Attacks:** Exploiting slippage by placing transactions immediately before and after a target transaction. This manipulation inflates the price for the target transaction and allows the extractor to profit from the price movement.
  
- **Time-Bandit Attacks:** Rewriting blockchain history by forking the chain to capture past MEV opportunities. This is more theoretical in practice due to the high costs and risks associated with reorganizing the blockchain.

Understanding these MEV opportunities is essential for modeling how different actors interact and how value can be redistributed to promote fairness.

---

## **3. Mathematical Framework**

To analyze MEV redistribution rigorously, we formalize the relationships between transactions, actors, and MEV extraction using mathematical models.

### **3.1. Transaction Sequencing and Permutation Space**

The set of all possible transaction orderings, or permutations, is denoted as $\Sigma$. For $n$ transactions, there are $n!$ possible permutations. Each permutation $\sigma \in \Sigma$ represents a potential ordering of transactions that can influence MEV extraction and the utility of different actors.

### **3.2. MEV Extraction Function**

The total MEV extracted given a transaction ordering $\sigma$ is defined as:

$$MEV_{\text{Extract}}(\sigma) = \sum_{m_j \in M} e_j(\sigma)$$

Where:

- $e_j(\sigma)$: The extractable value from MEV opportunity $m_j$ under ordering $\sigma$.

Alternatively, MEV can be expressed as the sum over transactions:

$$MEV_{\text{Extract}}(\sigma) = \sum_{t_i \in T} m(t_i, \sigma)$$

Where:

- $m(t_i, \sigma)$: The MEV extracted related to transaction $t_i$ under ordering $\sigma$.

This function captures how the arrangement of transactions can create or mitigate opportunities for extracting value.

### **3.3. Utility Functions**

Utility functions quantify the benefits and costs experienced by each actor, enabling the analysis of their incentives and strategic behaviors.

#### **3.3.1. Originators' Utility**

For each transaction $t_i$ submitted by an originator, the utility is:

$$U_O(t_i) = u_i - c_i - l_i + r_i$$

Where:

- $u_i$: The intrinsic utility from the successful execution of $t_i$, such as fulfilling a trade or transferring assets.
- $c_i$: The cost incurred by the originator, primarily the transaction fee $g_i$.
- $l_i$: The loss due to MEV extraction, which may include increased slippage, unfavorable execution prices, or failed transactions resulting from extractors' actions.
- $r_i$: The amount of MEV redistribution received by the originator, compensating for any losses.

This utility function reflects the originator's net benefit from participating in the blockchain network.

#### **3.3.2. Extractors' Utility**

The total utility for an extractor is:

$$U_E = \sum_{m_j \in M} e_j(\sigma) - C_E - \theta \cdot MEV_{\text{Extract}}(\sigma)$$

Where:

- $C_E$: Operational costs incurred by the extractor, including computational resources and network fees.
- $\theta$: A parameter representing any penalties or costs associated with MEV extraction, designed to discourage excessive or harmful extraction.

This utility function accounts for the profits from MEV opportunities while considering the costs and potential penalties.

#### **3.3.3. Builders' Utility**

Builders construct blocks and may also participate in MEV extraction:

$$U_B = F + MEV_{\text{Extract}}(\sigma) - C_B$$

Where:

- $F = \sum_{t_i \in T} g_i$: The total transaction fees collected from all transactions included in the block.
- $C_B$: The cost of building blocks, such as infrastructure expenses and energy consumption.

Builders aim to maximize their utility by optimizing block composition and potentially engaging in MEV extraction.

#### **3.3.4. Validators' Utility**

Validators add blocks to the blockchain, and their utility is:

$$U_V = R + R_{\text{MEV}} - C_V$$

Where:

- $R$: The block reward provided by the blockchain protocol for adding a new block.
- $R_{\text{MEV}}$: Any portion of MEV redistributed to validators.
- $C_V$: The costs associated with validation, including computational resources and energy consumption.

Validators are motivated to maintain the network's integrity while maximizing their rewards.

### **3.4. MEV Redistribution Function**

We introduce a redistribution function $\phi$ that allocates the extracted MEV among the various actors:

$$MEV_{\text{Redistribute}} = \phi(MEV_{\text{Extract}}(\sigma))$$

The function $\phi$ outputs a vector of redistributed MEV amounts:

$$\phi(MEV_{\text{Extract}}(\sigma)) = \left( R_O, R_E, R_B, R_V \right)$$

Subject to the constraint:

$$MEV_{\text{Extract}}(\sigma) = R_O + R_E + R_B + R_V$$

This function is central to our analysis, as it defines how the value extracted through MEV is shared among the participants, influencing their incentives and behaviors.

---

## **4. MEV Redistribution Mechanisms**

Different mechanisms for redistributing MEV can significantly impact the fairness and efficiency of the blockchain ecosystem. We explore several potential redistribution strategies.

### **4.1. Proportional Redistribution**

In proportional redistribution, MEV is distributed among actors based on predefined weights $w_X$ for each actor $X$:

$$R_X = w_X \times MEV_{\text{Extract}}(\sigma)$$

Constraints include:

- The weights must sum to one: $\sum_{X} w_X = 1$.
- Each weight must be non-negative: $w_X \geq 0$.

This mechanism allows for flexible allocation of MEV based on agreed-upon proportions, reflecting the perceived contributions or entitlements of each actor.

### **4.2. Originator-Centric Redistribution**

This approach prioritizes returning MEV to the transaction originators, aiming to compensate them for any losses due to MEV extraction:

$$R_O = \sum_{t_i \in T} \gamma_i \times m(t_i, \sigma)$$

Where:

- $\gamma_i \in [0,1]$: The proportion of MEV extracted from transaction $t_i$ that is returned to its originator.

The remaining MEV is distributed among other actors:

$$MEV_{\text{Extract}}(\sigma) - R_O = R_E + R_B + R_V$$

This mechanism seeks to enhance fairness by directly addressing the losses incurred by users.

### **4.3. Equal Redistribution**

In equal redistribution, MEV is divided equally among all participating actors:

$$R_X = \frac{MEV_{\text{Extract}}(\sigma)}{N}$$

Where $N$ is the total number of actors involved in the redistribution.

This method promotes equality but may not account for differences in contributions or needs among actors.

### **4.4. Stake-Based Redistribution**

Redistribution is based on each actor's stake $s_X$:

$$R_X = \left( \frac{s_X}{S} \right) \times MEV_{\text{Extract}}(\sigma)$$

Where:

- $S = \sum_{X} s_X$: The total stake of all actors.

Stake can be defined in terms of token holdings, computational resources, or other relevant metrics. This mechanism aligns MEV redistribution with the level of investment or participation of each actor.

## **5. Extending the Model: Reconciling Strategic Perspectives**

In the evolving blockchain ecosystem, reconciling the need for value redistribution to decentralized applications (dApps) with the imperative of minimizing user costs is a critical challenge. This section integrates strategic perspectives from key stakeholders to extend the foundational MEV redistribution model, aiming to balance equitable redistribution with cost minimization.

### **5.1. Stakeholder Perspectives**

#### **5.1.1. Redistribution's Perspective**

This view advocates for redistributing excess margins to dApps to enable tailored user acquisition strategies. Key points include:

- **Value Redistribution to dApps:** Excess revenue from congestion and MEV should be distributed back to dApps, allowing them to execute customized user acquisition strategies.
  
- **Competition Factors for Layer 2s (L2s):** Next-generation L2s will compete based on local fee markets, high-throughput execution, developer experience, and robust infrastructure. The key differentiator will be the ability to generate value for revenue-generating dApps through redistribution.
  
- **Balanced Node Operation:** Targeting a balance in the difficulty of running an L2 full node and managing state growth to ensure accessibility and scalability.

#### **5.1.2. Cap MEV Perspective**

This presents a critical view of value extraction practices, emphasizing:

- **Criticism of Value Extraction:** Extracting value from users to give to dApps benefits large players (whales) at the expense of regular users, leading to inequities.
  
- **Focus on Minimizing Costs:** Advocates for minimizing costs to users rather than redistributing extracted value. Identifies state growth as a significant challenge that should be addressed directly to improve scalability and reduce user burdens.

### **5.2. Integrating Perspectives into the Model**

To reconcile these perspectives, the model is extended to incorporate mechanisms that both redistribute MEV to dApps and minimize costs to users. This involves designing an incentive-compatible redistribution function that benefits originators without encouraging excessive extraction.

#### **5.2.1. User Costs ($C_U$)**

The total costs incurred by users include transaction fees and losses due to MEV:

$$C_U = \sum_{t_i} (c_i + l_i)$$

Minimizing $C_U$ is essential to enhancing user utility.

#### **5.2.2. MEV Extraction Limits ($M_{\text{max}}$)**

Introducing a cap on the amount of MEV that can be extracted prevents excessive extraction and protects users from disproportionate losses.

#### **5.2.3. Incentive-Compatible Redistribution Function ($\phi^*$)**

A redesigned redistribution function that aligns incentives, ensuring that MEV redistribution benefits originators without promoting harmful extraction practices.

---

## **6. Designing an Incentive-Compatible Redistribution Function**

### **6.1. Goals for the Redistribution Function**

The redistribution function $\phi^*$ should achieve the following:

- **Benefit Originators:** Ensure that users receive a fair share of redistributed MEV.
  
- **Prevent Excessive Extraction:** Discourage extractors from engaging in harmful MEV extraction practices.
  
- **Maintain or Reduce User Costs:** Avoid increasing transaction fees or losses due to MEV.
  
- **Align Incentives:** Encourage all actors to act in ways that benefit the overall ecosystem.

### **6.2. Mathematical Formulation of $\phi^*$**

We propose a redistribution function that allocates MEV based on the negative impact on users while penalizing excessive extraction:

$$\phi^*(MEV_{\text{Extract}}(\sigma)) = \left( R_O, R_E, R_B, R_V \right)$$

Where:

- $R_O = \alpha \cdot \sum_{t_i} l_i$
  
  Originators receive a proportion $\alpha$ of the total losses incurred due to MEV extraction.

- $R_E = (1 - \alpha - \beta) \cdot MEV_{\text{Extract}}(\sigma) - \lambda \cdot E_{\text{excess}}$
  
  Extractors receive the remaining MEV minus a penalty for excessive extraction.

- $R_B$ and $R_V$ are adjusted accordingly to ensure the total MEV is fully redistributed.

#### **Parameters:**

- $\alpha \in [0,1]$: Proportion of MEV losses returned to originators.
  
- $\beta \in [0,1-\alpha]$: Proportion allocated to builders and validators.
  
- $\lambda \geq 0$: Penalty rate for excessive extraction.
  
- $E_{\text{excess}} = \max(0, MEV_{\text{Extract}}(\sigma) - M_{\text{max}})$: Excess MEV extracted beyond the acceptable limit.

### **6.3. Constraints and Conditions**

- **MEV Extraction Cap ($M_{\text{max}}$)**: Defines the maximum acceptable MEV extraction level to prevent excessive extraction.
  
- **Zero Increase in User Costs:** Ensures that the redistribution mechanism does not lead to higher transaction fees or increased losses for users.
  
- **Balanced Budget Constraint:**

$$MEV_{\text{Extract}}(\sigma) = R_O + R_E + R_B + R_V$$

This ensures that the total MEV extracted is fully redistributed among the actors.

---

## **7. Mechanism Design**

### **7.1. Implementing MEV Extraction Limits**

#### **7.1.1. Dynamic MEV Caps**

- **Definition:** The cap $M_{\text{max}}$ is set dynamically based on network conditions, average MEV levels, or predefined thresholds.
  
- **Purpose:** Prevents extractors from increasing MEV extraction beyond acceptable levels that would harm users.

#### **7.1.2. Penalty Mechanism**

- **Functionality:** Extractors exceeding $M_{\text{max}}$ incur penalties, reducing their utility.
  
- **Redistribution:** Penalties are redistributed to originators, compensating for any additional losses incurred.

### **7.2. Aligning Incentives**

#### **7.2.1. Incentive-Compatible Redistribution**

- **For Extractors:** By imposing penalties for excessive extraction, extractors are incentivized to limit their MEV activities to acceptable levels. Their utility $U_E$ is maximized when $MEV_{\text{Extract}}(\sigma) \leq M_{\text{max}}$.
  
- **For Originators:** Receiving compensation ($r_i$) for MEV-related losses increases $U_O(t_i)$, encouraging continued participation and trust in the system.

#### **7.2.2. Role of dApps**

- **Value Pass-Through:** dApps receiving redistributed MEV can choose to pass on benefits to users or invest in improving services.
  
- **Competition Among dApps:** dApps may compete by offering better incentives to users, funded by their share of MEV redistribution.

### **7.3. Mechanism Summary**

1. **MEV Extraction Monitoring:** Track MEV extraction levels in real-time.
2. **Apply Caps and Penalties:** If extraction exceeds $M_{\text{max}}$, apply penalties reducing extractors' utilities.
3. **Redistribute MEV:** Allocate MEV to originators, dApps, builders, and validators according to $\phi^*$.
4. **Incentive Alignment:** Ensure actors maximize their utilities by adhering to the mechanism, promoting overall system health.

## **8. Systematic Analysis Approach**

To evaluate the effectiveness of different MEV redistribution mechanisms, we adopt a systematic analysis approach that includes simulation modeling, game-theoretical analysis, sensitivity analysis, and the use of fairness and efficiency metrics.

### **8.1. Simulation Modeling**

#### **8.1.1. Objective**

Simulation modeling aims to analyze the impact of various MEV redistribution mechanisms on the utilities of different actors under controlled conditions.

#### **8.1.2. Methodology**

- **Implement Redistribution Functions:** Apply different $\phi$ functions representing various redistribution mechanisms.
  
- **Calculate Utilities:** Compute the utilities $U_X$ for each actor under each mechanism and ordering.
  
- **Compare Outcomes:** Assess which mechanisms promote fairness and efficiency by comparing the results.

This approach allows for the simulation and observation of the effects of redistribution strategies in a controlled environment.

### **8.2. Game-Theoretical Analysis**

#### **8.2.1. Objective**

Game-theoretical analysis helps understand the strategic behaviors and incentives of actors under different MEV redistribution schemes.

#### **8.2.2. Non-Cooperative Game Model**

- **Players:** The set of actors $X = \{ O, E, B, V, D, L2 \}$.
  
- **Strategies:** Choices regarding transaction ordering, participation in MEV extraction, and adherence to redistribution protocols.
  
- **Payoffs:** Utilities $U_X$ derived from the strategies and the MEV redistribution mechanism in place.
  
- **Equilibrium Analysis:** Identify Nash equilibria where no actor can unilaterally improve their utility by changing strategies.

This analysis provides insights into the stability and sustainability of different redistribution mechanisms.

### **8.3. Sensitivity Analysis**

#### **8.3.1. Objective**

Sensitivity analysis assesses the robustness of redistribution mechanisms to changes in key parameters.

#### **8.3.2. Approach**

- **Parameter Variation:** Vary critical parameters such as weights $w_X$, costs $C_X$, and stakes $s_X$.
  
- **Impact Assessment:** Analyze how changes affect the utilities $U_X$ and the overall MEV distribution.
  
- **Threshold Identification:** Identify critical points where system behavior changes significantly, such as tipping points leading to centralization.

This analysis helps in understanding the resilience of mechanisms and in optimizing parameter choices.

### **8.4. Fairness and Efficiency Metrics**

#### **8.4.1. Fairness Index (FI)**

The Fairness Index measures the equality of MEV distribution among actors:

$$FI = 1 - \frac{\sum_{X} (R_X - \bar{R})^2}{N \times \bar{R}^2}$$

Where:

- $\bar{R} = \frac{MEV_{\text{Extract}}(\sigma)}{N}$: The average MEV received per actor.
  
- $FI \in [0,1]$: A value of 1 indicates perfect equality.

#### **8.4.2. Efficiency Metric (EM)**

The Efficiency Metric assesses the total utility across all actors:

$$EM = \sum_{X} U_X$$

A higher $EM$ indicates a more efficient system in terms of maximizing total utility.

These metrics provide quantitative measures to compare and evaluate different redistribution mechanisms.

## **13. Conclusion**

The comprehensive model presented in this article provides a systematic framework for understanding and analyzing MEV redistribution in blockchain systems. By formalizing the interactions between actors and incorporating mathematical formulations, we assess the incentives and outcomes associated with various redistribution mechanisms. Integrating strategic perspectives from key stakeholders, we extend the model to balance value redistribution with the imperative of minimizing user costs.

Our analysis underscores the importance of designing policies and protocols that promote fairness and efficiency. By balancing value redistribution and cost minimization, and aligning incentives through mechanisms like the proposed redistribution function $\phi^*$, we can mitigate the adverse effects of MEV and enhance the overall health of the blockchain ecosystem. Application Specific Sequencing (ASS) emerges as a powerful tool for dApps to control their order flow, offering the potential to reduce MEV opportunities and improve user experiences. Ultimately, the insights gained from this model can guide the development of fairer and more efficient blockchain protocols, benefiting all participants.

### **A. Numerical Example**

#### **A.1. Setup**

- **Transactions:** 5 transactions with varying MEV impacts.
  
- **Parameters:**
  - $M_{\text{max}} = 10$ units
  - $\alpha = 0.5$
  - $\beta = 0.3$
  - $\lambda = 2$

#### **A.2. Calculation**

- **Total MEV Extracted:** $MEV_{\text{Extract}}(\sigma) = 12$ units
  
- **Excess MEV:** $E_{\text{excess}} = 12 - 10 = 2$ units
  
- **Penalties Applied:** $\lambda \cdot E_{\text{excess}} = 2 \cdot 2 = 4$ units
  
- **Redistribution:**
  - $R_O = \alpha \cdot \sum_{t_i} l_i = 0.5 \cdot L$ (Assuming $L = 6$ units) $R_O = 0.5 \cdot 6 = 3$ units
  - $R_E = (1 - 0.5 - 0.3) \cdot 12 - 4 = (0.2 \cdot 12) - 4 = 2.4 - 4 = -1.6$ units

#### **A.3. Interpretation**

- **Negative $R_E$:** Indicates extractors incur a net loss due to penalties, discouraging excessive MEV extraction.
  
- **Originators Receive Compensation:** $R_O = 3$ units, increasing their utility.
  
- **Builders and Validators:** Receive $R_B$ and $R_V$ as per $\beta$.

This example illustrates how the proposed redistribution function $\phi^*$ effectively redistributes MEV while penalizing excessive extraction, thereby protecting originators and aligning incentives.

### **B. Notations and Definitions**

- **$u_i$:** Intrinsic utility of transaction $t_i$.
  
- **$c_i$:** Transaction cost (gas fee) for $t_i$.
  
- **$l_i$:** Loss due to MEV extraction for $t_i$.
  
- **$r_i$:** MEV redistribution amount received by the originator of $t_i$.
  
- **$MEV_{\text{Extract}}(\sigma)$:** Total MEV extracted given transaction ordering $\sigma$.
  
- **$M_{\text{max}}$:** Maximum acceptable MEV extraction level.
  
- **$E_{\text{excess}}$:** Excess MEV extracted beyond $M_{\text{max}}$.
  
- **$\phi^*$:** Incentive-compatible MEV redistribution function.
  
- **$FI$:** Fairness Index.
  
- **$EM$:** Efficiency Metric.

By extending the MEV redistribution model with carefully designed mechanisms, we achieve a balance between value redistribution and cost minimization, aligning incentives to benefit all participants in the blockchain ecosystem.
