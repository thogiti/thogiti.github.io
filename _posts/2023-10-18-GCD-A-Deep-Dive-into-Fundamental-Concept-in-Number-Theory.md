The numbers $12$ and $18$ share the divisors $1, 2, 3, and 6$, with $6$ being the largest. This set of common divisors can be created for any pair of non-zero integers, $a$ and $b$. The set will always include at least the number $1$, as it is a divisor of all integers. Since the set is finite, it will always have a maximum value.

# [Definition 1](#definition-1)

Let's consider two integers, a and b, where both are not zero. The largest number, d, that can divide both a and b is known as the greatest common divisor (gcd). We represent it as d = gcd(a, b).

Sure, here's a more readable and simplified version of your text using GitHub Markdown for mathematical notation:

Let's consider two integers `a` and `b`, where both are not zero. The set of common divisors between `a` and `b` has a maximum element, which we denote as `d`. This `d` is known as the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. We express this as $d = gcd(a, b)$.

This equation signifies that `d` is the largest integer that can divide both `a` and `b` without leaving a remainder.

**Examples.** $gcd(24, 52) = 4$, $gcd(9, 27) = 9$, $gcd(14, 35) = 7$, $gcd(15, 28) = 1$.
