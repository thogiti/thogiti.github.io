# Introduction

Imagine you’re running a high-frequency trading system that relies on guaranteed RPC throughput. One morning, a flash-commit bot stakes a massive amount of shMON just before the next snapshot, locks up most of the bandwidth for 10 seconds, and your trades miss the market. What happened?

[shMONAD](https://shmonad.xyz/) is an innovative Liquid Staking Token (LST) built on top of MON (Monad). Designed to let users stake MON while retaining liquidity, shMONAD enables holders to convert MON into shMON, bond tokens into isolated, policy-driven pools, and unbond after an escrow period . FastLane’s ShMonad protocol then leverages these bonded shMON deposits to [allocate network bandwidth proportionally](https://x.com/thogardpvp/status/1945533857937461670?s=46): if a user stakes $s_i$ tokens out of a total committed stake $S$, they receive

$$
r_i \;=\;\frac{s_i}{S}\;R_{\max}
$$

requests per second. This elegant mechanism is designed to align user experience with security incentives, but in practice, it establishes a high‑stakes, non‑cooperative game among participants.

# Mechanism Overview

Let $N$ denote the set of users, each holding $h_i$ shMON. Every user $i$ commits $s_i \le h_i$ for a fixed duration $T$ (e.g. 20 blocks ≈ 10 s), giving total stake

$$
S \;=\;\sum_{j\in N} s_j.
$$

With a global cap $R_{\max}$ (requests/sec), user $i$’s allocation is

$$
r_i \;=\;\frac{s_i}{S}\,R_{\max}
\quad(\text{if }S>0).
$$

If no one stakes ($S=0$), the protocol could evenly split $R_{\max}$ among active sessions, ensuring basic liveness. Meanwhile, staked tokens continue earning rewards, so the opportunity cost of locking $s_i$ is

$$
c_i(s_i)\approx \delta\,s_i\,T,
$$

where $\delta$ is the differential reward rate versus alternative staking options.

Each agent’s utility combines bandwidth value and staking cost:

$$
u_i(r_i, s_i) \;=\; v_i(r_i)\;-\;c_i(s_i),
$$

with $v_i$ concave (e.g. $v_i(r)=\alpha_i\log(1+r)$) to model diminishing returns.

**Mini Numerical Example:** Suppose three users stake $(10,30,60)$ tokens and $R_{\max}=100$. They receive $(10,30,60)$ RPS. A flash‑committer who stakes **900** tokens just before a snapshot jumps to **90 RPS** (90% of capacity), causing the original stakers’ allocations to plummet to $(1,3,6)$ RPS respectively, then instantly withdraws.

Having defined stakes, allocations, and utilities, let’s first see why this proportional rule is so compelling from a game-theoretic lens.

# Positive Properties: An Elegant Design

Despite its simplicity, ShMonad’s proportional-sharing rule exhibits several desirable theoretical features:

**Approximate Incentive Compatibility.** While not dominant-strategy incentive-compatible (DSIC), the mechanism admits a Bayes‑Nash equilibrium. Committing in proportion to one’s true valuation is a best response if others do the same, an analogue of [Kelly’s proportional-fairness](https://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~frank/rate.pdf) theorem in [networking](https://hal.science/hal-04240500/document).

**Static Efficiency.** At a static Nash equilibrium, total welfare

$$
W \;=\;\sum_i v_i(r_i)
$$

is Pareto-efficient under $\sum_i r_i \le R_{\max}$. If valuations correlate with wealth, the outcome approximates a [Lindahl equilibrium for public goods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16414).

**Collusion Resistance.** In large populations, the grand coalition’s core is empty: any small cartel can be undercut by defectors at minimal cost, limiting gains from collusion.

**Sybil Robustness.** Spawning sybil identities requires real stake ($\Omega(s_i)$), embedding a costly-signaling barrier against cheap identity-splitting attacks.

**Closed-Form Equilibrium.** For linear costs $c_i(s)=\gamma s$ and quadratic valuations $v_i(r)=\alpha_i r - \tfrac12\beta r^2$, one can solve

$$
s_i^* = \frac{\alpha_i(N-1) - \gamma\,S_{-i}}{\gamma\,N},
$$

making the system’s behavior predictable under idealized assumptions.

# Potential Vulnerabilities: Where the Model Breaks Down

## Arms Race to Over‑Commitment
   With near-zero opportunity cost, users’ best response is $s_i = h_i$. The total stake $S$ saturates at $H = \sum_i h_i$, and $r_i = (h_i/H) R_{\max}$, blind to real-time needs. This mirrors a **[Tullock contest](https://wine2024.org/slides/AGT_Blockchains_Workshop/Ghosh.pdf)** (participants expend costly effort for a share of a prize), leading to inefficient equilibria where effort dissipates value.

## Wealth Concentration & Centralization
   Proportionality maps token-holding inequality directly into bandwidth inequality. If $h_i$ follows a Pareto distribution, whales capture a super‑proportional share of $R_{\max}$. In repeated interactions, bandwidth dominance (e.g. MEV capture) compounds wealth, further centralizing control and undermining censorship resistance.

## Exploiting Unpredictability with Timing Attacks
   Commitments update only every $\Delta$, so $S(t)$ behaves stochastically (e.g. a birth–death process under Poisson events). The variance in $r_i$ can breach service thresholds. Worse, **flash‑commit bots** can stake huge $s_i'$ immediately before a snapshot, grab outsized bandwidth for one interval, then withdraw, an extensive-form exploit that skews fairness.

## Enforcement Paradoxes & Moral Hazard
   Measurement noise $\epsilon\sim\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2)$ leads to false positives. Penalties

   $$
     p = \kappa\,\max\bigl(u_i - r_i t,\;0\bigr)
   $$

   grow with $\sigma$, so honest users under‑utilize to avoid wrongful fines. Validators, rewarded by a share of penalties, face moral hazard to over-report, echoing [Holmström–Milgrom principal–agent problems](https://web.stanford.edu/~milgrom/publishedarticles/Multitask%20Principal%20Agent.pdf).

## Free‑Riding from Leaked Credentials
   If RPC URLs leak, free-riders consume $r_i$ without staking, shrinking effective rates to $r_i^{\rm eff}=(1-f),r_i$. This spawns a tragedy of the commons: users under-stake, collapsing $S$ and degrading service for all.

## Coordination Failures & Adoption Traps
   The protocol could admit two equilibria: a low‑adoption “ghost town” ($S\approx0$) and a high‑adoption “arms race” ($r_i\to0$ as $N\to\infty$). The tipping point

   $$
     v_i\bigl(R_{\max}/N_c\bigr) = c_i(h_i)
   $$

   induces hysteresis, hard to bootstrap healthy usage but difficult to unwind once saturated.

## Long‑Run Rich‑Get‑Richer Dynamics
   Reinvested bandwidth yields amplify initial imbalances via

   $$
     h_i(t+1) = h_i(t) + \eta\,r_i(t),
   $$

   triggering a “[Matthew effect](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4233686/)” that accelerates centralization absent corrective payment designs (e.g. Vickrey‑style rebates).

# Conclusion 

ShMonad’s proportional-sharing mechanism is elegant and efficient on a first approximation, but real‑world strategic behavior exposes it to arms races, centralization, timing exploits, and enforcement paradoxes. To safeguard long‑term resilience, FastLane should explore:

* **Quadratic Commitment Fees** ($f(s_i)=\beta,s_i^2$) to dampen over‑staking.
* **Time‑Weighted Stake Locks** to neutralize flash‑commit attacks.
* **Hybrid Auction Layers** (e.g. Harberger‑style taxes) for demand‑driven pricing.
* **Service‑Differentiated Pricing** (reads vs. writes) to align costs with resource use.

By combining ShMonad’s UX and MEV advantages with these refinements, FastLane can build a bandwidth marketplace that is both efficient and equitable, ready to power the next generation of latency-sensitive applications.
