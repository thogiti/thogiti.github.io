## Overview of Based Rollups

The "based" or "L1-sequenced" rollups, which are distinguished by their sequencing process that is directly driven by the base Layer 1 (L1) blockchain such as Ethereum. This design allows the next rollup block to be included as part of the next L1 block, facilitated by collaboration among L1 proposers, searchers, and builders[^1]. 

The term "based rollup" reflects their close integration with the base L1 and the concepts of tokenlessness and decentralization are shared goals that could be harmoniously aligned with Ethereum.


## Advantages of Based Rollups

Key advantages of based rollups include:

**Liveness and Decentralization:** Based rollups inherit the liveness and decentralization guarantees of the L1 blockchain, avoiding issues like weakened settlement guarantees, censorship-based maximal extractable value (MEV) vulnerabilities, and potential disruption of network effects due to mass exits in the event of sequencer failures.

**Simplicity:** The process is significantly simpler than other sequencing methods, requiring no sequencer signature verification, escape hatch, or external proof-of-stake consensus. This simplicity leads to reduced development costs and a smaller surface area for bugs.

**Cost Efficiency:** There's no gas overhead for signature verification, making based rollups more cost-effective. They also avoid the regulatory burden associated with token-based sequencing.

**Economic Alignment with L1:** MEV generated by based rollups flows to the L1 blockchain, strengthening its economic security and potentially improving the scarcity of its native token. This alignment can help rollups build legitimacy while still retaining the option for revenue from layer 2 congestion fees.

**Sovereignty:** Despite delegating sequencing to the L1, based rollups can maintain sovereignty, with the ability to have a governance token, charge base fees, and use those fees as they see fit.

## Disadvantages of Based Rollups

There are some disadvantages to based rollups:

**No MEV Income for Rollups:** Forgoing MEV to the L1 may limit direct revenue sources for the rollups to base fees, though this could potentially lead to an increase in overall income by leveraging security and alignment advantages to achieve market dominance.

**Constrained Sequencing:** Relying on L1 for sequencing reduces flexibility and could make providing certain services (like fast pre-confirmations and first come first served sequencing) more challenging.

## Design Space of Based Rollups

The design space of based rollups is very large and they are several details that need to be researched. For example, it is possible to extend a naive based rollup to capture L2 MEV within the rollup up to some extent. Not every rollup wants to giveup the full potential of MEV share to L1.

Here are two primary methods:

**Auction Mechanism within the L1 Contract:** A possible approach for rollups to capture their own MEV is by incorporating an auction mechanism, such as a Dutch auction, within the L1 contract. This would require the batch submitter to pay a fee (in ETH) to the contract, allowing the rollup to directly benefit from MEV.

**Batch Cancellation and Replacement via Bribes:** Another proposal is a system where recent batches (up to a specified small number, n) can be cancelled and replaced if a higher bribe is offered to the contract. This approach would increase the finality time of rollup transactions, as cancelled batches would essentially result in L2 reorgs. Furthermore, this could lead to inefficiencies, such as wasted gas for batches that are reorganized because their sequencers did not offer optimal bids. This mechanism also raises concerns about disrupting atomic composability between rollups, especially when their batches are submitted within the same L1 block.
