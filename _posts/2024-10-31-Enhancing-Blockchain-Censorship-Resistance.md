## Introduction

Maintaining censorship resistance (CR) is important to ensure the integrity, fairness, and decentralization of decentralized applications (dApps). Censorship resistance safeguards against malicious actors attempting to manipulate transaction processing, thereby preserving the foundational principles of blockchain systems.

 The Atlas framework incorporates failure costs and gas escrow mechanisms to deter malicious Solvers (pre-validators) from engaging in behaviors that could compromise system integrity. By aligning Solver incentives with system health, Atlas promotes a fair and resilient transaction processing environment.

However, as blockchain ecosystems grow more complex, the need for enhanced mechanisms to improve CR becomes evident. This article explores some advanced mechanisms and mathematical models aimed at expanding and refining the Atlas framework. Through analysis and discussions, we explore a set of enhancements designed to improve the framework's robustness, adaptability, and scalability.

## Dynamic Gas Pricing Models and Their Impact on Failure Costs

### Overview

The original Atlas framework incorporates a static gas price ($\phi_t$) in calculating failure costs. However, real-world blockchain environments exhibit volatile gas prices influenced by network congestion, transaction demand, and other stochastic factors. Introducing dynamic gas pricing models can enhance the robustness of failure costs, ensuring that the deterrence mechanism remains effective under varying network conditions.

### Motivation

The integration of stochastic gas price modeling extends the original deterministic failure cost model to a more realistic and adaptable framework. Additionally, the introduction of dynamic bid adjustments based on expected gas prices aligns Solver incentives with real-time network conditions, fostering a more resilient and fair Solver ecosystem.

### Original Mathematical Representation

The failure cost in the Atlas framework is defined as:

$$cfail(o_i) = \frac{b(o_i) - b(o^*_i)}{\Gamma} g(o_i)$$

Here, $b(o_i)$ represents the bid of Solver operation $o_i$, $b(o^*_i)$ is the bid of the successful Solver operation $o^*_i$, $g(o_i)$ denotes the gas reserved for Solver operation $o_i$, and $\Gamma$ is the total gas available for Solver operations.

### Proposed Mathematical Enhancements

To better capture the real-world dynamics of gas prices, we can introduce a stochastic model for gas prices:

$$
\phi_t \sim \mathcal{F}(\mu, \sigma^2)
$$

In this equation, $\mathcal{F}$ represents a probability distribution (such as Normal or Log-Normal), with $\mu$ as the mean gas price and $\sigma^2$ as the variance.

Incorporating this into the failure cost formula, we can adjust it to account for dynamic gas prices:

$$
cfail(o_i, \phi_t) = \frac{b(o_i) - b(o^*_i)}{\Gamma} g(o_i)  \cdot \phi_t
$$

This modification ensures that the penalty reflects current network conditions, maintaining the economic deterrent against malicious Solver behavior.

Furthermore, we can derive the expected failure cost under stochastic gas prices:

$$
\mathbb{E}[cfail(o_i)] = \frac{b(o_i) - b(o^*_i)}{\Gamma} g(o_i) \cdot \mathbb{E}[\phi_t]
$$

Assuming $\phi_t$ is independent of $o_i$, the expectation simplifies to:

$$
\mathbb{E}[cfail(o_i)] = \frac{b(o_i) - b(o^*_i)}{\Gamma} g(o_i) \cdot \mu
$$

### Further Mathematical Analysis

The introduction of $\sigma^2$ in the gas price model significantly influences Solver strategies. Solvers must now consider not only the expected failure cost but also its variability, which can be modeled using risk-averse utility functions:

$$
U_i(b_i, v_i, \phi_t) = P(o_i \text{ wins}) \times (v_i - b_i - \phi_t) + P(o_i \text{ fails}) \times (\mathbb{E}[cfail(o_i)] - \phi_t) - \gamma \cdot \text{Var}[cfail(o_i)]
$$

Here, $\gamma$ represents the risk aversion coefficient. To maximize utility under uncertainty, Solvers may employ strategies that hedge against high gas price scenarios:

$$
\max_{b_i} \mathbb{E}[U_i(b_i, v_i, \phi_t)]
$$

Subject to:

$$
b_i \leq v_i
$$

Incorporating the dynamic failure cost, the expected utility becomes:

$$
\mathbb{E}[U_i(b_i, v_i, \phi_t)] = P(o_i \text{ wins}) \times (v_i - b_i - \mu) + P(o_i \text{ fails}) \times \left(\frac{b(o_i) - b(o^*_i)}{\Gamma} g(o_i) \cdot \mu - \mu \right)
$$

### Implications

By accounting for dynamic gas prices, the system remains resilient against sudden spikes or drops in gas fees, ensuring that the failure cost mechanism adapts in real-time to maintain effective deterrence. Solvers are compelled to adopt more sophisticated bidding strategies that factor in gas price volatility, promoting fair competition and preventing exploitation of predictable gas costs.

### Added Value

Dynamic failure costs ensure that penalties remain proportionate and effective regardless of network conditions, preventing Solvers from exploiting predictable gas pricing. This approach enhances the system's robustness across diverse scenarios, maintaining integrity and fairness even under fluctuating network states.


### Additional Discussion Points

The choice of distribution $\mathcal{F}$ is important; while Normal distributions offer analytical tractability, Log-Normal distributions might better capture the skewness observed in real gas price data. Calibrating the risk aversion coefficient $\gamma$ is essential to ensure that the model accurately reflects Solver preferences and market realities. Furthermore, assessing the impact of dynamic gas pricing on overall transaction throughput is necessary to identify and mitigate any potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies introduced by this enhancement.

## Robustness Against Sybil and Collusion Attacks

### Overview

Sybil and collusion attacks pose significant threats to the integrity of decentralized systems by enabling malicious actors to manipulate bidding processes and monopolize block space. Enhancing the Atlas framework to be robust against such attacks is paramount for maintaining censorship resistance and fair Solver competition.

### Motivation

The integration of reputation scores and staking requirements extends beyond the original failure cost and gas escrow models, introducing advanced mechanisms that deter coordinated malicious behaviors. Additionally, applying coalitional game-theoretic modeling ensures that collusion is not a profitable strategy, further securing the system against coordinated attacks.

### Original Mathematical Representation

The original failure cost in the Atlas framework is defined as:

$$
cfail(o_i) = \frac{b(o_i) - b(o^*_i)}{\Gamma} g(o_i)
$$

### Proposed Mathematical Enhancements

To mitigate the risks posed by Sybil and collusion attacks, we can introduce several key enhancements:

#### Sybil Attack Probability Modeling

We define the probability that a group of Sybil identities can influence the bidding outcome as:

$$
P_{\text{Sybil}} = \left( \frac{M}{N} \right)^k
$$

Here, $M$ represents the number of malicious Sybil identities, $N$ is the total number of Solvers, and $k$ denotes the number of simultaneous malicious attempts.

#### Collusion Game-Theoretic Framework

Utilizing coalitional game theory, we model Solver collusion and its impact on system stability. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a coalition of $m$ Solvers aiming to manipulate the bidding process. The utility of the coalition is given by:

$$
U_{\mathcal{C}} = \sum_{i \in \mathcal{C}} V_i
$$

Solvers in $\mathcal{C}$ strategize to maximize their collective utility:

$$
\max_{b_i \forall i \in \mathcal{C}} U_{\mathcal{C}} = \sum_{i \in \mathcal{C}} \left( v_i - b_i - \phi_t - cfail(o_i) \right)
$$

#### Reputation-Based Defenses

We integrate a reputation system $\rho_i$ that penalizes Solvers for past malicious behaviors, reducing the impact of Sybil and collusion attacks:

$$
\rho_i = f(\text{Historical Success}, \text{Behavior Metrics})
$$

The function $f$ aggregates reliability and behavior metrics to compute the reputation score. Incorporating reputation into bidding adjusts Solver bids as follows:

$$
b_i(v_i) = \frac{N - 1}{N} v_i \cdot \rho_i
$$

#### Staking Mechanisms

To further deter malicious behavior, we require Solvers to stake funds that can be slashed upon detection of Sybil or collusion attacks:

$$
s_i \geq \kappa \cdot \phi_t \cdot g(o_i)
$$

Here, $s_i$ is the amount staked by Solver $i$, and $\kappa$ is a multiplier ensuring substantial staking. The slashing mechanism is defined as:

$$
\text{If } o_i \text{ is malicious, then } s_i \leftarrow s_i - \lambda \cdot s_i
$$

where $\lambda$ is the slashing percentage applied to malicious Solvers.

### Further Mathematical Analysis

The introduction of reputation scores $\rho_i$ effectively reduces the influence of Sybil identities by diminishing their reputation proportionally. Assuming $\rho_i < 1$ for malicious Solvers, the adjusted Sybil attack probability becomes:

$$
P_{\text{Sybil}}^{\text{Adjusted}} = \left( \frac{M \cdot \rho_i}{N} \right)^k
$$

Applying game-theoretic principles, we ensure that coalitions are not profitable. By penalizing coalitions through reputation scores and staking, the system maintains Nash Equilibrium stability, discouraging Solvers from forming collusive groups:

$$
\forall \mathcal{C}, \quad U_{\mathcal{C}}^{\text{Adjusted}} < U_{\mathcal{C}}^{\text{Non-Adjusted}}
$$

The reputation function $f$ can be modeled as:

$$
\rho_i = \frac{\text{Number of Successful Bids}}{\text{Total Bids Submitted}} \cdot e^{-\lambda \cdot \text{Penalties Incurred}}
$$

where $\lambda$ is the decay rate for penalties, ensuring that reputation accurately reflects recent Solver behavior.

### Implications

By coupling reputation scores and staking mechanisms, Solvers are economically disincentivized from engaging in Sybil or collusion attacks, as the potential losses from slashing outweigh the benefits of manipulation. Reputation-based defenses ensure that only trustworthy Solvers can effectively participate in the bidding process, maintaining the system's fairness and integrity.

### Added Value

The combination of reputation systems and staking mechanisms creates a multi-layered security framework that significantly enhances the system's resilience against Sybil and collusion attacks. Economic deterrents align Solver incentives with system integrity, fostering a cooperative and fair Solver ecosystem.


### Additional Discussion Points

Calibrating the reputation score involves determining optimal weighting factors and decay rates to accurately reflect Solver trustworthiness without introducing undue complexity or biases. Designing fair and effective slashing rules is important to punish malicious behavior without inadvertently penalizing honest Solvers. Furthermore, ensuring that the reputation system remains scalable and efficient as the number of Solvers increases is essential to prevent bottlenecks or vulnerabilities.

## Advanced Reputation Systems for Solver Trustworthiness

### Overview

A robust reputation system is critical for maintaining Solver trustworthiness, especially in environments susceptible to Sybil and collusion attacks. By tracking Solver performance and behavior over time, the system can incentivize honest participation and penalize malicious actions, thereby enhancing overall system security and fairness.

### Motivation

The introduction of an integrated reputation scoring system extends beyond the original failure cost mechanism, offering a mathematically robust method to evaluate and incorporate Solver trustworthiness into the bidding and selection processes. Additionally, dynamic reputation adjustments ensure that reputation scores remain relevant and accurate, adapting to Solver behaviors over time.

### Original Mathematical Representation

While the original paper does not explicitly define a reputation system, it alludes to supplementary mechanisms to strengthen censorship resistance.

### Proposed Mathematical Enhancements

To develop a comprehensive reputation system, we propose a multifaceted reputation score $\rho_i$ that incorporates historical performance and behavior metrics:

$$
\rho_i = \alpha R_i + \beta S_i + \gamma P_i
$$

In this equation, $R_i$ represents the historical reliability score (such as the percentage of successful bids), $S_i$ denotes the success rate of Solver operations (e.g., the number of times $o_i \in O^*_i$), and $P_i$ accounts for penalties incurred from failed or malicious bids. The coefficients $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ determine the influence of each component on the overall reputation score.

To ensure that $\rho_i$ reflects current Solver performance, we implement a dynamic reputation adjustment mechanism that incorporates time-decay and recent behavior:

$$
\rho_i(t) = e^{-\lambda t} \rho_i(t-1) + \mu \cdot \text{Recent Performance}(t)
$$

Here, $\lambda$ is the decay rate for older performance data, and $\mu$ is the weight assigned to recent performance updates.

### Reputation-Based Solver Selection Probability

The probability of a Solver's operation being selected is adjusted based on their reputation score:

$$
P(o_i \text{ selected}) = \frac{b(o_i) \times \rho_i}{\sum_{j=1}^{N} b(o_j) \times \rho_j}
$$

This formulation ensures that higher-reputation Solvers have a proportionally higher chance of having their operations selected, thereby rewarding consistent and trustworthy behavior.

### Reputation Impact on Failure Costs

We integrate reputation scores into the failure cost calculation to dynamically adjust penalties:

$$
cfail(o_i, \rho_i) = \frac{b(o_i) - b(o^*_i)}{\Gamma} g(o_i) \cdot \rho_i
$$

Lower-reputation Solvers face higher failure costs, further deterring malicious behavior.

### Further Mathematical Analysis

Solvers aim to maximize their reputation scores to increase their selection probability and minimize failure costs. Their utility function, considering the reputation score, is given by:

$$
U_i = P(o_i \text{ selected}) \times (v_i - b_i - \phi_t) + (1 - P(o_i \text{ selected})) \times (cfail(o_i, \rho_i) - \phi_t) + \eta \cdot \rho_i
$$

Subject to:

$$
\rho_i = \alpha R_i + \beta S_i + \gamma P_i
$$

Incorporating reputation scores affects the Nash Equilibrium of the bidding game:

$$
b_i^*(v_i) = \frac{N - 1}{N} v_i \cdot \rho_i
$$

This adjustment aligns Solver incentives with honest behavior, as higher $\rho_i$ directly enhances their bid effectiveness and utility.

### Implications

Quantifying Solver trustworthiness promotes accountability, ensuring that only reliable and honest Solvers are favored in the bidding process. The reputation system aligns Solver incentives with desired behaviors, fostering a cooperative and fair Solver ecosystem. Additionally, the time-decay mechanism ensures that reputation scores remain reflective of current behaviors, preventing long-term reputations from overshadowing recent malicious actions.

### Added Value

The comprehensive and dynamic reputation scoring system provides a scalable framework for evaluating Solver trustworthiness, significantly enhancing the system's security by reducing the efficacy of Sybil and collusion attacks. By maintaining an accurate and up-to-date reflection of Solver behavior, the reputation system ensures that only trustworthy participants are rewarded, thereby maintaining the system's fairness and integrity.


### Additional Discussion Points

Designing the reputation function $f$ requires balancing historical performance with recent behaviors to prevent reputation inflation and ensure timely penalization of malicious actions. Determining optimal values for the weighting factors $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ is important to effectively balance reliability, success rates, and penalties. Moreover, safeguarding the reputation system against potential attacks aimed at artificially inflating reputation scores is essential to maintain its integrity.

## Incentive-Compatible Mechanisms and Truth-Telling Strategies

### Overview

Ensuring that the bidding mechanism is incentive-compatible is important for maintaining the integrity of the system. Incentive compatibility ensures that Solvers are motivated to bid their true valuations ($v_i$) rather than manipulating their bids for personal gain, thereby promoting fairness and preventing strategic manipulations.

### Motivation

Applying advanced mechanism design principles, such as Myerson's Revelation Principle and VCG mechanisms, ensures that the bidding strategy is incentive-compatible. Additionally, integrating reputation scores into the Solver's utility function provides a more nuanced incentive structure that promotes long-term honest behavior.

### Original Mathematical Representation

The original equilibrium bid strategy in the Atlas framework is defined as:

$$
b_i(v_i) = \frac{N - 1}{N} v_i
$$

where $b_i(v_i)$ is the bid of Solver $i$ based on their valuation $v_i$, and $N$ is the total number of Solvers.

### Proposed Mathematical Enhancements

To ensure that truth-telling is a dominant strategy for Solvers, we apply principles from mechanism design. Specifically, we align the bidding mechanism with Myerson's Revelation Principle, ensuring that Solvers maximize their utility by bidding truthfully.

We extend the equilibrium concept to account for private information and beliefs about other Solvers' bids using the Bayesian Nash Equilibrium framework. The Bayesian Solver utility is expressed as:

$$
U_i(b_i, v_i) = P(b_i \text{ wins}) \times (v_i - b_i - \phi_t) + P(b_i \text{ fails}) \times (cfail(o_i) - \phi_t)
$$

The equilibrium condition requires that:

$$
\forall i, \quad b_i^*(v_i) = \arg\max_{b_i} \mathbb{E}[U_i(b_i, v_i)]
$$

Incorporating reputation scores $\rho_i$ and dynamic failure costs into the Solver's utility function further aligns incentives:

$$
U_i(b_i, v_i, \rho_i) = P(o_i \text{ selected}) \times (v_i - b_i - \phi_t) + (1 - P(o_i \text{ selected})) \times (cfail(o_i, \rho_i) - \phi_t) + \eta \cdot \rho_i
$$

Additionally, we employ the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism principles to verify that truth-telling maximizes Solver utility. The VCG payoff is defined as:

$$
V_i^{VCG} = \sum_{j \neq i} v_j \cdot \mathbb{I}(b_j > b_i) - \text{Externality}_i
$$

By demonstrating that the current bid strategy aligns with VCG principles, we can confirm the incentive compatibility of the bidding mechanism.

### Further Mathematical Analysis

Dominant Strategy Incentive Compatibility (DSIC) is achieved by proving that truth-telling maximizes Solver utility, regardless of other Solvers' strategies:

$$
\forall i, \forall v_i, \forall b_i' \neq b_i(v_i), \quad U_i(b_i(v_i), v_i, \rho_i) \geq U_i(b_i', v_i, \rho_i)
$$

By setting $b_i(v_i) = \frac{N - 1}{N} v_i$, Solvers maximize their expected utility without deviating from truthful bidding.

Bayesian Nash Equilibrium Stability is maintained by adjusting the equilibrium bid strategy to incorporate reputation scores:

$$
b_i^*(v_i) = \frac{N - 1}{N} v_i \cdot \rho_i
$$

This adjustment ensures that Solvers optimize their bids based on their valuations and reputation scores, maintaining equilibrium stability even as system parameters evolve.

Finally, aligning the bidding strategy with VCG mechanisms ensures that externalities are accounted for, further promoting truth-telling as the optimal strategy:

$$
V_i = \sum_{j \neq i} v_j \cdot \mathbb{I}(b_j > b_i) - \text{Externality}_i = \text{Current Mechanism Payoff}
$$

### Implications

Ensuring that truth-telling is a dominant strategy prevents Solvers from engaging in bid shading or overbidding, thereby maintaining fair competition and system integrity. Integrating reputation scores into the utility function incentivizes Solvers to maintain high reputations, aligning their interests with honest participation.

### Added Value

The application of mechanism design principles to ensure incentive compatibility guarantees that the bidding process remains fair and transparent. By preventing strategic bid manipulations, the system upholds the principles of decentralization and fairness, essential to blockchain integrity.


### Additional Discussion Points

Formal proofs are required to demonstrate that the proposed bidding strategy aligns with VCG mechanisms, ensuring incentive compatibility. Assessing the scalability of reputation integration is essential, especially in large-scale Solver environments. Furthermore, exploring how Solvers can optimize their utility under the new bid strategy, considering both valuations and reputation scores, can provide deeper insights into Solver behavior and system dynamics.

## Multi-Phase Auctions and Dynamic Bidding Strategies

### Overview

Implementing multi-phase auctions introduces a temporal dimension to the bidding process, allowing Solvers to adjust their bids dynamically based on previous phase outcomes. This approach can enhance fairness, distribute execution opportunities more evenly, and mitigate the risk of block space monopolization by strategic Solvers.

### Motivation

Expanding the original single-phase bidding mechanism to a multi-phase structure adds a temporal layer that enhances fairness and system resilience. Empowering Solvers to iteratively refine their bids based on phase outcomes fosters a more adaptive and strategic Solver ecosystem.

### Original Mathematical Representation

The original equilibrium bid strategy in the Atlas framework is defined as:

$$
b_i(v_i) = \frac{N - 1}{N} v_i
$$

where $b_i(v_i)$ is the bid of Solver $i$ based on their valuation $v_i$, and $N$ is the total number of Solvers.

### Proposed Mathematical Enhancements

To incorporate multi-phase auctions, we structure the bidding process into multiple distinct phases. Each phase allows Solvers to submit or adjust their bids based on the outcomes of previous phases. In phase $k$, the bid adjustment can be represented as:

$$
b_i^{(k)}(v_i) = \frac{N_k - 1}{N_k} v_i + \alpha_k \cdot \phi_t^{(k)}
$$

Here, $N_k$ denotes the number of active Solvers in phase $k$, $\alpha_k$ is an adjustment factor based on the gas price in phase $k$, and $\phi_t^{(k)}$ is the gas price at phase $k$.

Solvers are allowed to iteratively adjust their bids based on the success or failure of their bids in previous phases:

$$
b_i^{(k+1)}(v_i) = b_i^{(k)}(v_i) + \Delta b_i^{(k)}
$$

where $\Delta b_i^{(k)}$ represents the bid increment or decrement based on phase $k$ outcomes.

### Phase-Wise Solver Selection and Iteration

In a multi-phase auction system, Solver selection occurs iteratively across phases. If a bid in phase $k$ fails, the system proceeds to phase $k+1$, allowing the next Solver in line to attempt execution. The payoff for Solver $i$ in phase $k$ is defined as:

$$
V_i^{(k)} = 
\begin{cases}
v_i - b_i^{(k)} - \phi_t^{(k)} - cfail(o_i^{(k)}) & \text{if } o_i^{(k)} \in O^{*(k)}_i \\
-\phi_t^{(k)} - cfail(o_i^{(k)}) & \text{if } o_i^{(k)} \notin O^{*(k)}_i \text{ and } o_i^{(k)} \in \text{Reverted Operations} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

### Further Mathematical Analysis

Determining the optimal number of phases $K$ and the distribution of Solvers across phases is critical for maximizing system efficiency and fairness. The objective is to maximize the total Solver payoffs across all phases while ensuring that the sum of active Solvers across phases equals the total number of Solvers:

$$
\max_{K} \sum_{k=1}^{K} \sum_{i=1}^{N_k} V_i^{(k)}
$$

Subject to:

$$
\sum_{k=1}^{K} N_k = N
$$

Solver decision-making across phases can be modeled using dynamic programming or reinforcement learning frameworks to identify optimal bidding adjustments:

$$
\pi_i = \arg\max_{\pi_i} \sum_{k=1}^{K} \gamma^k U_i^{(k)}(b_i^{(k)}, v_i)
$$

where $\pi_i$ is the policy function for Solver $i$ and $\gamma$ is the discount factor for future utilities.

Assessing the impact of multi-phase structures on system stability involves analyzing the partial derivatives of the utility functions with respect to bid adjustments:

$$
\frac{\partial U_i}{\partial b_i^{(k)}} = 0 \quad \forall i, \forall k
$$

### Implications

Multi-phase auctions prevent a single Solver from monopolizing block space by distributing execution slots across phases, promoting fairness and diversity. Solvers can refine their bidding strategies based on observed outcomes in previous phases, leading to more intelligent and responsive behaviors. Additionally, iterating through multiple phases allows the system to process more transactions without overburdening any single phase, optimizing overall throughput and efficiency.

### Added Value

The introduction of temporal fairness ensures that all Solvers, regardless of their initial bid strength, have multiple opportunities to execute their operations. Strategic bidding insights provide a framework for understanding Solver behaviors in dynamic environments, enabling further optimization of the auction mechanism.


### Additional Discussion Points

Determining optimal durations and frequencies for each phase is essential to balance responsiveness with system efficiency. The availability and dissemination of information from previous phases can significantly impact Solver bidding strategies. Additionally, evaluating whether the added complexity of multi-phase auctions yields sufficient benefits in terms of fairness and system resilience is important.

## Integration with Layer-2 Solutions and Cross-Chain Interoperability

### Overview

As blockchain ecosystems expand, integrating the Atlas framework with Layer-2 (L2) scaling solutions and ensuring cross-chain interoperability becomes important. This integration enhances scalability, reduces transaction costs, and broadens the framework's applicability across diverse blockchain networks.

### Motivation

The extension of failure cost and gas escrow mechanisms to Layer-2 solutions and cross-chain interactions ensures consistent security and fairness across diverse blockchain environments. Additionally, introducing cross-chain reputation synchronization mechanisms maintains Solver trustworthiness uniformly, enhancing reliability and trust across interconnected chains.

### Original Mathematical Representation

The original Atlas framework adjusts the gas limit to reserve the smallest gas required by any Solver operation:

$$
\Gamma' = \Gamma - \min \{g(o) : o \in O\}
$$

Here, $\Gamma'$ represents the adjusted gas limit after reserving gas for the smallest Solver operation.

### Proposed Mathematical Enhancements

#### Layer-2 Gas Dynamics Modeling

To accommodate the unique gas price structures and scalability features of Layer-2 solutions, we extend the failure cost and gas escrow mechanisms:

$$
\phi_t^{(L2)} = g(\phi_t^{(L1)}, \lambda)
$$

In this equation, $\phi_t^{(L2)}$ is the gas price on Layer-2, $g$ is a function modeling the relationship between Layer-1 ($L1$) and Layer-2 ($L2$) gas prices, and $\lambda$ is a scaling factor based on Layer-2 scalability parameters.

#### Cross-Chain Solver Operation Mapping

We define Solver operations across multiple chains to ensure consistent application of failure costs and gas escrow mechanisms:

$$
O_{Solver}^{(Chain_i)} = \{ o_{i1}, o_{i2}, \dots, o_{in} \}
$$

Each Solver operation $o_{ij}$ on chain $i$ has an associated failure cost:

$$
cfail(o_{ij}, \phi_t^{(Chain_i)}) = \frac{b(o_{ij}) - b(o^*_{ij})}{\Gamma_i} g(o_{ij}) \cdot \phi_t^{(Chain_i)}
$$

where $\Gamma_i$ is the total gas available on chain $i$, and $\phi_t^{(Chain_i)}$ is the gas price on chain $i$.

#### Interoperability Constraints and Optimization

To ensure that cross-chain interactions do not compromise the failure cost mechanisms or gas escrow requirements, we establish the following constraint:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{C} \Gamma_i' \geq \Gamma_{\text{Total}}
$$

Here, $C$ is the number of interconnected chains, $\Gamma_i'$ is the adjusted gas limit on chain $i$, and $\Gamma_{\text{Total}}$ is the aggregate gas limit required across all chains.

#### Consistent Equilibrium Bid Strategies Across Chains

To maintain fairness across chains, we adapt the equilibrium bid strategy to accommodate cross-chain Solvers:

$$
b_i^{*(Chain_j)}(v_i) = \frac{N_j - 1}{N_j} v_i \cdot \rho_i
$$

In this equation, $N_j$ is the number of Solvers on chain $j$, and $\rho_i$ is the reputation score of Solver $i$.

#### Cross-Chain Reputation Synchronization

To maintain Solver trustworthiness across multiple chains, we ensure that reputation scores $\rho_i$ are synchronized or transferable:

$$
\rho_i^{(Chain_j)} = h(\rho_i^{(Chain_k)})
$$

Here, $h$ is a function ensuring consistent reputation scores across chains $j$ and $k$.

### Further Mathematical Analysis

Modeling the impact of integrating multiple Layer-2 solutions on system scalability and gas usage efficiency involves:

$$
\Gamma_{\text{Total}} = \sum_{i=1}^{C} (\Gamma_i' \cdot \eta_i)
$$

where $\eta_i$ is the efficiency factor for chain $i$.

Ensuring fair Solver selection across chains is achieved by maintaining proportional reputation and bid amounts:

$$
P(o_i^{(Chain_j)} \text{ selected}) = \frac{b(o_i^{(Chain_j)}) \times \rho_i}{\sum_{k=1}^{C} \sum_{m=1}^{N_k} b(o_m^{(Chain_k)}) \times \rho_m}
$$

This formula ensures that reputation and bid amounts are fairly weighted across chains, maintaining equitable Solver selection probabilities.

### Implications

Integration with Layer-2 solutions allows the Atlas framework to handle a higher volume of transactions with reduced gas costs, enhancing overall system scalability and efficiency. Cross-chain interoperability extends the framework's applicability, enabling seamless operation across diverse blockchain ecosystems. Synchronizing reputation scores across chains ensures that Solver trustworthiness is maintained uniformly, preventing reputation inflation or deflation due to cross-chain activities.

### Added Value

Leveraging Layer-2 scalability features enables the Atlas framework to manage increased transaction volumes without compromising system integrity or efficiency. Cross-chain interoperability broadens the scope and impact of the framework, facilitating its adoption across multiple blockchain networks. Unified reputation management across chains ensures consistent Solver trustworthiness, reinforcing the system's security and fairness.


### Additional Discussion Points

Designing efficient and secure protocols for synchronizing reputation scores and Solver states across different blockchain networks is essential. Developing accurate and responsive functions $g(\phi_t^{(L1)}, \lambda)$ to model gas price dynamics between Layer-1 and Layer-2 solutions is important for maintaining system stability. Furthermore, assessing potential vulnerabilities introduced by cross-chain interactions and developing safeguards to mitigate associated risks is vital to ensure system security.

## Partial Reverts and Transaction Atomicity

### Overview

Partial reverts allow specific Solver operations within a transaction to fail without causing the entire transaction to revert. This mechanism enhances system flexibility and user experience by ensuring that only targeted operations are penalized, maintaining overall transaction integrity.

### Motivation

A formally defined partial revert mechanism introduces a mathematically rigorous framework for handling Solver operation failures without disrupting the entire transaction. Establishing an iterative Solver selection process enhances system resilience and fairness by ensuring continuous transaction processing until a successful bid is achieved.

### Original Mathematical Representation

The original Solver payoff structure in the Atlas framework is defined as:

$$
V_i = 
\begin{cases}
v_i - b(o_i) - \phi_t - cfail(o_i) & \text{if } o_i \in O^*_i \\
-\phi_t - cfail(o_i) & \text{if } o_i \notin O^*_i \text{ and } \exists o_{-i} \in O^*_i \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

Here, $V_i$ represents the payoff for Solver $i$, and $O^*_i$ is the set of successful Solver operations.

### Proposed Mathematical Enhancements

To implement partial reverts, we introduce atomicity constraints ensuring that the execution of individual Solver operations does not compromise the atomicity of the entire transaction:

$$
\forall o_i \in O, \quad \text{Execute}(o_i) \Rightarrow \text{Atomicity}(O)
$$

This means that each Solver operation $o_i$ is treated as an atomic unit, where the execution of one does not necessitate the execution or failure of others.

Partial Revert Functionality allows specific Solver operations to revert without affecting others within the same transaction:

$$
\text{Revert}(o_i) \neq \text{Revert}(O)
$$

This ensures that only individual operations can fail, maintaining the integrity of the entire transaction.

The modified Solver payoff structure accommodates partial reverts as follows:

$$
V_i = 
\begin{cases}
v_i - b(o_i) - \phi_t - cfail(o_i) & \text{if } o_i \in O^*_i \\
-\phi_t - cfail(o_i) & \text{if } o_i \notin O^*_i \text{ and } o_i \in \text{Reverted Operations} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

Here, $\text{Reverted Operations}$ is the subset of $O$ where specific Solver operations have failed.

Sequential Solver Iteration is introduced to implement an iterative Solver selection process. If a bid in phase $k$ fails, the system proceeds to the next Solver in phase $k+1$, allowing continuous transaction processing until a successful bid is found:

$$
\forall o_i \in O, \quad \text{if } o_i \text{ fails}, \quad \text{move to } o_{i+1}
$$

### Further Mathematical Analysis

To maintain transaction consistency despite partial reverts, we define transaction integrity constraints ensuring that the overall transaction state remains consistent:

$$
\sum_{o_i \in O} \text{State}(o_i) = \text{Consistent}
$$

Solvers optimize their bids to maximize their utility, considering the possibility of partial reverts:

$$
\max_{b_i} U_i = P(o_i \text{ succeeds}) \times (v_i - b_i - \phi_t - cfail(o_i)) + P(o_i \text{ fails}) \times (-\phi_t - cfail(o_i))
$$

Ensuring that gas resources are allocated efficiently is achieved by reserving gas for the smallest Solver operation:

$$
\Gamma' = \Gamma - \min \{g(o) : o \in O\}
$$

This ensures that subsequent Solvers have sufficient gas to attempt execution without overcommitting resources.

### Implications

Partial reverts prevent entire transactions from failing due to isolated Solver operation failures, reducing the need for users to resubmit orders and enhancing overall user experience. This flexibility allows the system to handle a diverse range of Solver operations, accommodating both high-reward and low-reward transactions without compromising transaction integrity. Moreover, sequential Solver iteration ensures that multiple Solvers have opportunities to execute their operations, promoting fairness and preventing monopolization by any single Solver.

### Added Value

The introduction of partial reverts allows for granular penalization of only malicious or failed Solver operations, preserving the execution of legitimate operations and maintaining transaction integrity. Additionally, optimizing gas utilization ensures that resources are allocated efficiently across Solver operations, maximizing system throughput and minimizing resource wastage.


### Additional Discussion Points

Developing formal proofs to ensure that partial reverts do not introduce inconsistencies or vulnerabilities in transaction states is essential. Analyzing how the possibility of partial reverts influences Solver bidding strategies is important to determine whether it effectively deters malicious behavior. Additionally, exploring algorithms for efficient Solver iteration and selection can further optimize system throughput while maintaining fairness.

## Exploring Alternative Mechanisms Beyond Failure Costs and Gas Escrow

### Overview

While failure costs and gas escrow form the cornerstone of the Atlas framework's security and deterrence mechanisms, exploring additional mechanisms can further enhance system robustness and fairness. This research area investigates supplementary strategies such as time-locked commitments, randomized Solver selection, staking requirements, multi-dimensional bidding, and incentive redistribution.

### Motivation

The integration of time-locks, staking requirements, multi-dimensional bidding, and incentive redistribution extends the original failure cost and gas escrow mechanisms. These advanced mechanisms provide a holistic security and fairness framework, enabling the system to adapt dynamically to varying Solver strategies and network conditions.

### Original Mathematical Representation

The original Atlas framework incorporates failure costs and adjusts gas limits as follows:

$$
cfail(o_i) = \frac{b(o_i) - b(o^*_i)}{\Gamma} g(o_i)
$$

$$
\Gamma' = \Gamma - \min \{g(o) : o \in O\}
$$

### Proposed Mathematical Enhancements

#### Time-Locked Commitments

To enforce bid stability, we define a time-lock expiration for each Solver operation $o_i$:

$$
T_i(o_i) = t_i + \Delta t
$$

where $T_i(o_i)$ is the time-lock expiration time, $t_i$ is the current time, and $\Delta t$ is the fixed duration for the time-lock.

#### Solver Commitment Constraint

Solvers are constrained by:

$$
\text{Cannot alter } b(o_i) \text{ or withdraw } e(i) \text{ before } T_i(o_i)
$$

Violations of this commitment result in additional penalties:

$$
\text{Penalty}(o_i) = \lambda \cdot cfail(o_i)
$$

Here, $\lambda$ is the penalty multiplier for commitment violations.

#### Adjusted Solver Payoff with Time-Locked Commitments

The Solver payoff structure is modified to incorporate penalties for commitment violations:

$$
V_i = 
\begin{cases}
v_i - b(o_i) - \phi_t - cfail(o_i) & \text{if } o_i \in O^*_i \text{ and } T_i(o_i) \leq t \\
-\phi_t - cfail(o_i) - \lambda \cdot cfail(o_i) & \text{if } o_i \notin O^*_i \text{ and } o_i \in \text{Reverted Operations} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

#### Randomized Solver Selection

Introducing randomness in Solver operation execution reduces predictability and deters targeted censorship. The probability of Solver $i$'s operation $o_i$ being selected is adjusted as follows:

$$
P(o_i \text{ selected}) = \frac{b(o_i) \times \rho_i}{\sum_{j=1}^{N} b(o_j) \times \rho_j} \times \theta
$$

where $\theta$ is the randomness factor ensuring non-deterministic selection.

#### Staking Requirements

To further deter malicious behavior, Solvers are required to stake a certain amount of funds, which can be slashed upon detection of Sybil or collusion attacks:

$$
s_i \geq \kappa \cdot \phi_t \cdot g(o_i)
$$

where $s_i$ is the amount staked by Solver $i$, and $\kappa$ is a staking multiplier ensuring significant economic commitment. The slashing mechanism is defined as:

$$
\text{If } o_i \text{ is malicious, then } s_i \leftarrow s_i - \lambda \cdot s_i
$$

#### Multi-Dimensional Bidding

Allowing Solvers to bid across multiple dimensions (e.g., bid amount, reputation weight) introduces a vector of bids:

$$
b_i(o_i) = (b_i^{(1)}, b_i^{(2)}, \dots, b_i^{(k)})
$$

where each component $b_i^{(k)}$ represents a bid in dimension $k$.

#### Incentive Redistribution

Allocating a portion of MEV or gas fees to all participating Solvers promotes cooperative behavior. The redistribution formula is:

$$
V_i = 
\begin{cases}
v_i - b(o_i) - \phi_t - cfail(o_i) + \beta \cdot \sum_{j=1}^{N} V_j & \text{if } o_i \in O^*_i \\
-\phi_t - cfail(o_i) + \beta \cdot \sum_{j=1}^{N} V_j & \text{if } o_i \notin O^*_i \text{ and } o_i \in \text{Reverted Operations} \\
\beta \cdot \sum_{j=1}^{N} V_j & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

Here, $\beta$ is the redistribution coefficient.

### Further Mathematical Analysis

#### Time-Locked Commitments Impact

**Commitment Adherence Enforcement**

To ensure that Solvers adhere to their commitments, we formalize the constraints:

$$
\forall o_i \in O, \quad b_i(t < T_i(o_i)) = b_i(t = T_i(o_i)) = b_i^{(original)}(v_i)
$$

This equation ensures that bids remain unchanged before the time-lock expires, maintaining bid stability.

**Penalty Optimization**

Determining the optimal penalty multiplier $\lambda$ is important to balance deterrence effectiveness without overly penalizing honest Solvers:

$$
\lambda \cdot cfail(o_i) \geq \text{Maximal Solver Gain from Violation}
$$

This ensures that Solvers are deterred from committing violations as the penalty exceeds any potential gains from bid alterations or escrow withdrawals.

**Utility Function Adjustment**

The adjusted utility function accounts for penalties associated with commitment violations:

$$
U_i(b_i, v_i, T_i) = P(o_i \text{ selected}) \times (v_i - b_i - \phi_t - cfail(o_i)) + (1 - P(o_i \text{ selected})) \times (-\phi_t - cfail(o_i) - \lambda \cdot cfail(o_i))
$$

This formulation incentivizes Solvers to adhere to their commitments to avoid additional penalties, aligning their strategies with system integrity.

#### Randomized Solver Selection Impact

Introducing stochastic elements into Solver selection reduces predictability, thereby deterring targeted attacks. The variance in selection probability is:

$$
\text{Var}(P(o_i \text{ selected})) = \theta(1 - \theta) \cdot \left( \frac{b(o_i) \times \rho_i}{\sum_{j=1}^{N} b(o_j) \times \rho_j} \right) \left(1 - \frac{b(o_i) \times \rho_i}{\sum_{j=1}^{N} b(o_j) \times \rho_j}\right)
$$

Higher variance implies greater randomness, enhancing deterrence against predictable Solver strategies.

#### Staking and Slashing Dynamics

Modeling Solver utility with staking and slashing penalties:

$$
U_i(b_i, v_i, s_i) = P(o_i \text{ selected}) \times (v_i - b_i - \phi_t) + P(o_i \text{ fails}) \times (cfail(o_i) - \phi_t) - s_i \cdot \mathbb{I}(o_i \text{ malicious})
$$

#### Multi-Dimensional Bidding Optimization

Solving for optimal bid vectors across multiple dimensions involves maximizing Solver utility subject to their bid budget:

$$
\max_{b_i^{(1)}, b_i^{(2)}, \dots, b_i^{(k)}} U_i = \sum_{k=1}^{K} \left[ P(o_i^{(k)} \text{ selected}) \times (v_i^{(k)} - b_i^{(k)} - \phi_t^{(k)}) + P(o_i^{(k)} \text{ fails}) \times (cfail(o_i^{(k)}) - \phi_t^{(k)}) \right] + \eta \cdot \rho_i
$$

Subject to:

$$
\sum_{k=1}^{K} b_i^{(k)} \leq B_i
$$

where $B_i$ is the total bid budget for Solver $i$.

### Implications

By combining failure costs with additional mechanisms such as time-locks, staking, and randomized selection, we create a multi-layered security framework that deters a wide range of malicious behaviors. Multi-dimensional bidding and incentive redistribution ensure that Solvers are motivated to participate honestly while also benefiting from cooperative behaviors. This comprehensive approach enhances system resilience, fairness, and efficiency.

### Added Value

Introducing multiple security layers beyond failure costs and gas escrow significantly enhances the system's robustness against sophisticated attacks. Optimizing Solver participation through diverse incentive structures promotes a healthy and fair Solver ecosystem, aligning Solver interests with system integrity.


### Additional Discussion Points

Balancing the introduction of multiple mechanisms with maintaining system simplicity and usability is important. Determining optimal values for coefficients such as $\alpha_k, \beta, \gamma, \lambda$ and $\Delta t$ is important to maximize deterrence while minimizing unintended side effects. Assessing the impact of time-locked commitments on Solver flexibility and system dynamics is necessary to ensure that legitimate Solver adjustments are not unduly constrained. Additionally, ensuring that the introduced mechanisms complement existing failure cost and gas escrow strategies is vital to prevent conflicts and maintain system coherence.
