In this article we study the strengths, weaknesses, and implementation challenges of **Multiple Concurrent Block Proposers (MCP)**[^1] and **Fork-Choice Enforced Inclusion Lists (FOCIL)**[^2], with a particular focus on the BRAID MCP model as discussed in the recent Paradigm Research Workshop[^3]. The primary goal of ths article is to provide a comprehensive understanding of how these mechanisms can enhance censorship resistance (CR) in blockchain systems.

_Note that both MCP and FOCIL are recent topics in the blockchain research and not much has been written or published about these topics apart from few high level presentations and articles. It is too early in the research to critically argue about their technical specifications and design decisions of these proposals._
