## WIP - Work in Progress

## [Introduction](#introduction)

In this blog post, we will unpack and review the key insights and contributions of  the paper “Robust Restaking Networks.” We will explore the innovative models and conditions proposed by Durvasula and Roughgarden, aimed at ensuring that restaking networks remain secure even in the face of potential attacks. From the importance of overcollateralization to the mathematical characterization of robust security, we will break down the complex concepts cryptoeconomic security in restaking networks and understand the significance of this research in the context of blockchain security.
