# [Overview](#overview)

ZKSNARKS are a powerful cryptographic tool that can enable zero-knowledge proofs, which are a way of verifying the validity of a computation without revealing any information about the inputs or outputs. ZKSNARKS can be used to create privacy-preserving applications, such as anonymous transactions, verifiable computation, and decentralized identity. However, working with ZKSNARKS is not easy, as it requires a deep understanding of the underlying mathematical and cryptographic primitives, as well as the practical challenges of implementing them.

In this article, we will guide you through the process of mastering practical knowledge of working with ZKSNARKS and cryptographic primitives. We will cover the following topics in detail and show you how they are done in practice:

- Trusted Setup: How to generate the public parameters and the proving and verification keys for a ZKSNARK circuit.
- Exponentiation ZK Circuit: How to design and implement a ZK circuit that performs exponentiation over a finite field.
- Hashing with keccak ZK Circuit: How to design and implement a ZK circuit that performs hashing with the keccak algorithm.
- Sparse Merkle Tree ZK Circuit: How to design and implement a ZK circuit that proves membership or non-membership in a sparse Merkle tree.
- Workflow automation for development of ZK Circuits: How to use tools and frameworks to automate the development and testing of ZK circuits.

By the end of this article, you will have a solid foundation of working with ZKSNARKS and cryptographic primitives, and you will be able to apply them to your own projects. Let's get started!
