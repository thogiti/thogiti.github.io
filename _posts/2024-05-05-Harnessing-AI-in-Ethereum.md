## Overview

Public blockchains like Ethereum provide an ideal infrastructure for the development and operation of AI agents, due to their distinctive features that align perfectly with the needs of decentralized, autonomous systems. These platforms not only support but enhance the capabilities of AI agents, fostering a new era of technological integration that could reshape societal and economic structures. Let’s explore why blockchains are the prime stage for AI's evolution and the profound benefits they offer.

Davide Crapis wrote an [excellent article](https://davidecrapis.notion.site/The-Internet-of-Agents-23aa09799b9c4620a1a287926bcfd6af) on the role of AI agents in blockchain[^1]. I will refer the user to follow this article for a more non-technical introduction to the topic. 

In this article I will develop some ideas on how to explore this design space of AI agents and their orchestration mechanism and how these AI agents can be designed in the current Miner Extractable Value (MEV) supply chain architecture in the current Proposer Builder Separation (PBS) scheme to bring out the true potential of AI in Ethereum blockchain infrastructure. 

I have written about PBS and MEV in my [ePBS article](https://thogiti.github.io/2024/03/28/ePBS.html). If you are new to these topics, you may want to start [here](https://thogiti.github.io/2024/03/28/ePBS.html).

By integrating AI into Ethereum blockchain environments, particularly in managing the MEV supply chain in the current PBS scheme, we can address complex challenges and enhance the efficiency and security of blockchain operations. Here's a detailed exploration of some innovative AI-driven applications designed to optimize the blockchain landscape.

Below I will explore high level overview of some problems in the MEV supply chain architecture and how to build coordination and collaboration games using AI agents to solve these challenges. In the future articles, I will develop these problems further to understand their design space, mechanism designs, value creation, AI methodlogy and implementation details. 

## Privacy-Preserving Real-Time Auction System for Ethereum Block Space Allocation

In Ethereum MEV auctions for block space, maintaining bidder privacy is crucial. But in the current MEV-Boost architecture such guarantees are weak. AI agents using Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC) or Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) can manage encrypted bids to prevent exposure and manipulative behaviors. These AI systems ensure that only the auction system knows the true bid values (in the worst case), enhancing both the privacy and fairness of auctions.

**Problem Statement:**  
Securely conducting auctions for a block space allocation without exposing sensitive bid information to maintain bidder privacy and prevent manipulative behaviors.

**Technical Approach:**  
Deploy AI agents that utilize Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC) or FHE to handle bids. AI algorithms process encrypted bids, ensuring that bid values are only revealed to the auction system (in the worst case) and not to other bidders.

**Mechanism Design:**
- $B = ${ $b_1, b_2, ..., b_n$ } represents a set of bids.
- AI agents compute $max(B)$ in a privacy-preserving manner.
- Ensure that  $\forall b_i \in B$, data is encrypted and secure.

**Data Required:**  
Encrypted bids for the block, Relay APIs auction data, Ethereum transaction data for verification post-auction.

**Evaluation Criteria:**  
- Bid privacy preservation.
- Auction fairness and transparency.
- Time to finalize auction results.

**Optimization Potential:**  
Refine cryptographic techniques and multi-round auction mechanism designs to reduce computational overhead and improve auction performance.

## AI-Coordinated Block Construction within Fixed Time Slots 

AI agents can dramatically improve how transactions are packaged into a block and ordered within Ethereum’s 12-second block time. By analyzing pending transactions in the mempool, these agents maximize network fees and optimize block space utilization, boosting overall network throughput.

**Problem Statement:**  
To maximize block value and network throughput, the inclusion of transactions within Ethereum's 12-second block time must be optimized by carefully balancing private data pools and public mempools.

**Technical Approach:**  
- **AI Agents:**  
  AI agents dynamically analyze and order transactions from both private data pools and public mempools to optimize network fees and efficiently utilize block space.

**Mathematical Model:**  
- **Transaction Sets:**

- **Optimization Function:**  
  $f(B) = \max\left(\sum_{t \in T_{\text{PA}}} \text{fees}(t) + \sum_{t \in T_{\text{PB}}} \text{fees}(t)\right),$
  where B is the block to be filled, $T_{PA}$ and $T_{PB}$ are the private and public pools of transactions to be included respectively, and $fees(t)$ is the transaction fee for a given transaction $t$.

**Constraints:**  
The optimization must comply with block size and time constraints.

**Mechanism Design:**  
1. **Define Transaction Set:**  
   Identify the optimal transaction set, $T$, within a block, $B$.
   
2. **Optimize BB:**  
   Implement an AI system that learns patterns in real-time mempool data and historical block data to select and order transactions that maximize network fees and efficiently utilize block space.

**Data Requirements:**

## Off-Chain Computation for On-Chain Efficiency 

AI can also reduce the computational load on the blockchain. By performing complex calculations off-chain and then integrating the results back on-chain using cryptographic proofs and cryptoeconomic ecurity mechanisms like EigenLayer[^2] and Ritual[^3], we reduce transaction costs and enhance overall network performance.

## Dynamic Trade Routing in MEV Scenarios 

During periods where MEV is detectable, AI agents can route transactions through optimal pathways to minimize costs and slippage. By continuously learning from the network state, these agents adapt and optimize the routes in real time.

## AI-Powered MEV Supply Chain Management

Streamlining the MEV supply chain involves managing the flow of transactions efficiently from wallets to proposers. AI agents orchestrate this flow, ensuring that transactions are bundled appropriately and sent to the most suitable builders based on current network conditions.

## Privacy-Enhanced Channel Management for Secure Transaction Handling

To secure private transaction channels, AI is used to manage and monitor operations, utilizing advanced encryption and anomaly detection to protect data against unauthorized access and potential leaks.

## AI-Driven Block Building Simulation for Optimal Proposal Strategies 

AI can simulate various block-building strategies in a virtual environment. This allows for testing and optimization of strategies without risking live network stability, leading to more effective and efficient blockchain operations.

## NLP and LLM for Simplified MEV Interaction 

Implementing natural language processing (NLP) and Large Language Model (LLM) systems can make interacting with Ethereum more accessible. Users can input commands in natural language, which are then translated into actionable functions or structured queries, simplifying the user experience.

## Decentralized AI Marketplaces for Dynamic MEV Strategies 

Creating decentralized marketplaces for AI-driven MEV strategies can foster a robust trading environment. Here, strategies are tokenized and traded securely, with smart contracts ensuring transaction integrity and compliance.

In the future articles, we will further develop these problems and understand their design space, mechnism design and implementation details.
